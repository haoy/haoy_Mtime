    <h1>About the Website</h1>

    <p> I'm a master student in Electrical and Computer Engineering department in Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
    <p> I love movies, that's why I chose to create Movie Time as my individual website for
        18641 Introduction to Software Engineering course.</p>
    <p> The functions I want this website to realize are as follows:</p>
    <p> As a guest, you are able to view comments, movie posters and information,
        however, you can not post your own comments.</p>
    <p> As a user, you can sign in and sign out of the website.When you are signed in,
        you can create your own comments about different movies and share them with others.</p>
